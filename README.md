Promises Rate Limiting
===

Native promises based library for rate limited parallel execution of async tasks.

This is a rare implementation of limiting parallel executions by count, not by time (throttling).

See [the list of issues](https://github.com/nilfalse/rate-limited/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) for a rough project's roadmap.
Feel free to create new discussions in issues as well.
